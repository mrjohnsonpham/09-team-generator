Template Engine - Employee Summary
One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. Here we are building a NODE CLI to take in information about employees and generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, this app has been ensured that all unit tests have pass.

Once the user has filled out each prompt regarding their full name, position, employee ID, email, and or school then the application will have created a full team that will generate and create a HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
